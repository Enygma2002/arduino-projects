Small project that rotates a platform (robot head?) based on the person's movement around it, always facing the person. The sensors are mounted on the platform.

## Components

3 x Ultrasonic Sensors
1 x PIR Sensor
1 x Servo Motor

## Work in Progress

Status: Experimenting with Ultrasonic sensors in detecting the nearest object and determining the rotation needed to center on it.
